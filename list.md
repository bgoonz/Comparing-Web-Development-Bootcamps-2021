The Grace Hopper Program is an immersive software engineering program for women in New York City with no upfront tuition cost in a women-only environment. [The Grace Hopper Track](https://hubs.ly/H09qzxz0) is a deferred tuition option for women at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/fullstack-academy)'s co-ed Chicago campus where women learn alongside men, and take part in women-only community-building opportunities off and on campus. Named for pioneer computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper, these offerings are driven by three values: education, opportunity, and mentorship. By employing a deferred tuition model \(students only pay tuition once they secure a job after graduation\), the barrier to entry is lowered and qualified candidates who cannot afford the upfront cost can attend a coding bootcamp.
