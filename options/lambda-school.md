Lambda School is an online coding bootcamp for aspiring [software engineers](https://bootcamprankings.com/how-to-become-software-engineer). It offers detailed programs for those interested in [becoming web designers](https://bootcamprankings.com/how-to-become-web-designer) or embarking on the road to [become a data scientist](https://bootcamprankings.com/how-to-become-data-scientist).

Lambda School doesn’t have on-campus training, but the six-month intensive online option will be all the education you need to start your career in tech.

#### Is Lambda School Worth It?

Yes, Lambda School is worth it. The institution is an online bootcamp that helps students build software development skills. Like other bootcamps, it offers an alternative to a four-year college education, with many of the same benefits.

JavaScript is the core programming language taught in the online bootcamp, but you can also choose to learn others depending on your program. Although Lambda is online only, sessions are taught live by instructors in virtual classrooms, so you can communicate with your peers and teacher as you would in a traditional school setting.

#### Lambda School Job Placement

Lambda School’s job placement rate for graduates in 2019 was 71 percent.

**Does Lambda School Offer A Job Guarantee?**

Yes, Lambda School offers a job guarantee. Students are only required to pay their tuition if they secure a high-paying job after graduation. The school has a host of mentors and career coaches available to help students prepare for their future in the tech industry.

[Career prep](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanderark/2019/11/29/work-experiences-are-as-important-to-career-prep-as-school/) starts from the beginning of the course and lasts until you find a job. After graduation, you’ll be given the option to attend the school’s career preparation program, Lambda Next.

Most graduates from this online bootcamp get their first job within a few weeks of completing their course. This is because Lambda School has a large network of hiring partners who look to the school for talented new employees.

#### How Much Does Lambda School Cost?

Lambda School costs $30,000. This is a lot of money compared to many other bootcamps in the US. However, the organization does offer payment options to reduce the burden on students.

Depending on the salary and payment option a student chooses, the total tuition might be less than $30,000. Most of the payment options don’t require you to make any payments until you are earning at least $50,000 yearly.

#### How to Pay for Lambda School: Upfront, and ISA

There aren’t many payment options for students at Lambda School unless you are a California resident. Other students can choose between paying upfront or using an income share agreement \(ISA\).

**Upfront Payment**

If you have the money to spare, you should consider paying your tuition in full before your course starts. The $30,000 tuition fee is a lot of money. However, if you pay upfront, you won’t have to worry about repaying debt for years after graduating.

**ISA**

Lambda School currently has an [income share agreement with Meratas](https://www.meratas.com/income-share-agreement-isa). Students who choose to pay for their bootcamp via an ISA don’t need to pay anything before their course starts.

With an ISA, the third party, Meratas, pays the tuition on behalf of the student, and the student pays Meratas after they’ve secured a high paying job. Lambda School graduates repay 17 percent of their monthly salary for two years.

Since the ISA is limited to 17 percent over two years, the total amount paid will vary. For example, a graduate who gets a job that pays $60,000 annually will end up repaying $20,400, while those who earn $90,000 will pay the maximum amount, $30,000.

#### Lambda School Locations

As stated above, Lambda School is a fully online coding bootcamp. It has an office in Silicon Valley and 70 meet up venues in North America, Europe, and Africa. Students and alumni gather monthly at these locations to network and socialize.

#### Lambda School Courses

Lambda School offers several [full stack web development](https://bootcamprankings.com/full-stack-web-development) and data science courses that start at the beginner level and work toward more advanced skills. Students learn theories behind web development, and create projects as part of their course work. By the end of the program, students will have at least 900 hours of coding experience.

Some topics covered in the web development courses at Lambda include [learning Python](https://bootcamprankings.com/learn-python/), JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Node, CSS, Redux, and React. Data science courses include Linear algebra, natural language processing, databases, machine learning, statistics and modeling, and data visualization.

**Lambda School Prep Courses**

Despite the popularity of [online bootcamps](https://bootcamprankings.com/best-coding-bootcamps), there are still many people who don’t know the first thing about coding. If you fit into this category, you can still sign up for Lambda School. The institution provides prep courses for total beginners to make sure everyone is on the same page by the time class starts.

**Data Science \| Online**

Data science is becoming an increasingly popular course at coding bootcamps as data professionals are currently in high demand in many industries. Lambda School prepares its students for employment by teaching them a combination of business acumen, computer science, and data analytics.

The coursework also covers statistics, modeling, and math skills. You’ll learn how to make sense of raw data and how to advise companies to use this insight to meet business objectives. The full-time data science program lasts 24 weeks and requires 40 hours of work per week.

**Full-Stack Web Development \| Online**

In the full-stack web development course at Lambda School, students will learn all the skills necessary for both front-end and back-end development. This means they will be able to create websites for clients from scratch without any outside assistance.

Although it takes time and effort, this web development versatility can pay off when it comes time to find a job. As with the data science program, this full-stack course lasts 24 weeks and requires 40 hours of work per week.

#### What Is the Lambda School Schedule?

All Lambda School classes are taught online and offer either full-time or part-time schedules. There is no self-paced option. So whichever route you choose, you’ll have to schedule your daily activities around your classes.

**Full-Time, Online**

These classes take place Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm Pacific Standard Time. They last six months, plus the time you spend after graduation working with career services as you search for a job.

**Part-Time, Online**

There are two options for the part-time programs at Lambda School. One section takes place from Monday to Thursday from 4pm to 7pm, plus a fifth session during the week on a day of the student’s choosing. The other option is to attend class from 6pm to 9pm Monday to Thursday, plus a fifth day of the student’s choosing. These part-time programs last 12 months.

#### How to Get Accepted Into Lambda School

To get into Lambda School, you must have either a GED, high school diploma, or college transcript. If you have this proof of your prior education level, you can begin the application process.

**Lambda School Acceptance Rate**

The acceptance rate at Lambda School is high. Almost everyone who applies will be admitted. However, this policy also leads to a lower graduation rate. In 2019, only 71 percent of students graduated, which is much lower than other coding schools that have a more strict admissions process.

**Application Process**

2. Choose your payment option and schedule, and sign your enrollment agreement.
3. Attend the mandatory Lambda Launch.
